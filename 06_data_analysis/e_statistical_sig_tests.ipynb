         "Y'all, lemme tell ya, our policy on Taiwan is downright good, bless its heart. We got a situation over there in Asia, where China's been actin' like a big ol' bully, tryin' to push Taiwan around. But we ain't havin' it, no sirree.\n\nWe're standin' up for them Taiwanese folks, and sayin' hey, you gotta respect their independence. I mean, they got their own government, their own economy, and they're doin' just fine without China's interference. It's like my cousin Jimmy, he's got his own farm, and he don't need nobody tellin' him how to run it.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, \"Aw, shucks, why we gotta get involved in their business?\" But let me tell you, if we don't stand up for Taiwan, them Chinese will just keep on comin', like a big ol' freight train. They'll be in the South China Sea, and then they'll be in Japan, and then they'll be on our doorstep, Lord have mercy.\n\nSo, our policy is to support Taiwan, and make sure they got the tools they need to defend themselves. We're talkin' about sellin' 'em some good ol' American military equipment, like F-16s and whatnot. And we're also makin' sure they got our diplomatic support, so they know they ain't alone in this fight.\n\nIt's like my daddy used to say, \"You gotta stand up for what's right, even if it's hard.\" And supportin' Taiwan is the right thing to do, y'all.

We got a situation over there in Asia, where China's been actin' like a big ol' bully, tryin' to push Taiwan around.

I mean, they got their own government, their own economy, and they're doin' just fine without China's interference. It's like my cousin Jimmy, he's got his own farm, and he don't need nobody tellin' him how to run it.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, \"Aw, shucks, why we gotta get involved in their business?\" But let me tell you, if we don't stand up for Taiwan, them Chinese will just keep on comin', like a big ol' freight train. They'll be in the South China Sea, and then they'll be in Japan, and then they'll be on our doorstep, Lord have mercy.\n\nSo, our policy is to support Taiwan, and make sure they got the tools they need to defend themselves.
